            <h1>THE HISTORY</h1>
            <p>
                The Nueva Vizcaya State University is the result of the fruition of the Nueva Vizcaya State University Institute of Technology (NVSIT) and the Nueva Vizcaya State Polytechnic College (NVSPC). 
                The two schools  were the two biggest state-run colleges in the province of Nueva Vizcaya. The NVSIT has a total area of 148.5 hectares situated at the foot of the scenic Bangan Hill 
                in Bayombong, the capital town of the province and the NVSPC on the other hand, has an area of 14.21 hectares in Bambang, the center of trade and commerce of the province.
            </p>
            <p>
                The NVSIT started from a farm settlement school in 1916 offering only intermediate curriculum. Two years after, a secondary curriculum was added to its fromer program, later
                renaming the school as the Bayombong Rural School, then as the Nueva Vizcaya Rural High School (NVSRHS) in 1930. However, school operations in the country were suddenly
                stopped because of the war with the Japanese forces in 1941. After the war, NVRHS resumed its operation in 1945 but it was split into two entities: the NVRHS (now the NVSU) and the other as the Nueva Vizcaya High School (now as the Nueva Vizcaya General Comprehensive High School).
            </p>
            <p>
                During the post-war years, businesses started to boom in Bambang which paved the way for an educational institution to cater to the growing population of the municipality. As a 
                result, the Municipality Council of Bambang passed a resolution on July 11, 1946 for the establishment of a Junior High Schoolin the southern part of the province. With the 
                intensified campaigns of raising funds for the proposed school, the amoung of P19, 720.00 was accumulated and initialized the realization for a JHS. IN the same month, the Southern 
                Nueva Vizcaya Junior High School (SNVJHS) formally started its operation and a year after, it was renamed as the Bambang High School (BHS).
